# Serve Vanity URLs via alt-f4.dev

This repository is responsible for serving vanity URLs for Go libraries.

See [this blog post](https://gianarb.it/blog/go-mod-vanity-url)
for a hands-on description of how this works.
There are [other solutions](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/govanityurls)
to it, but I wanted to keep it simple.
